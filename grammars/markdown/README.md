**This branch will no longer be actively maintained. For a more stable version see the [split_parser branch](https://github.com/MDeiml/tree-sitter-markdown/tree/split_parser)**

# tree-sitter-markdown
A markdown parser for tree-sitter

For now this implements the [CommonMark Spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/). Maybe it will be extended to support [Github flavored markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)

## Disclaimer

This parser is still quite experimental.
